== PROJECT: ClerkPro

---

== Overview

ClerkPro is a desktop application used for managing clinic's appointments, queue and scheduling. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to enqueue/dequeue patients into the queue*
** What it does: allows the user to add patients into the queue based on the `referenceId` of the patient. It also allows the user to remove patients from the queue based on the index number.
** Justification: This feature has high priority as the user (clerk/receptionist) would need to add or remove patients from the queue.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to serve patients and assign them to a doctor*
** What it does: serves the first patient in the queue and assigns them to a doctor based on the index number.
** Justification: This feature is important as the user (clerk/receptionist) would need to assign patients in the queue to doctors.

* *Major enhancement 3*: added *the ability to keep track of doctors on duty*
** What it does: allows the user to be able to know how many doctors are on duty. Also, allows the user to know if any doctors went for a break.
** Justification: This feature is useful as it allows the user (clerk/receptionist) to know how many doctors are on duty and is able to assign patients to them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added compatibility with the undo/redo commands

=== Queue Management

==== Adds a patient to the queue: `enqueue` ====

Adds a patient to the queue based based on the patient's Id. The enqueued patient must be a registered. Staff members cannot be enqueued. +

Format: `enqueue <PATIENT_REFERENCE_ID>` +

==== Removes a patient from the queue: `dequeue` ====

Removes a patient from the queue based on their queue position. +

Format: `dequeue <QUEUE_INDEX>`

==== Assigns next patient to an available doctor : `next` ====
//todo add doctor first

Assigns the next patient in the queue to a doctor. +

Format: `next <ENTRY_ID>`

==== Doctor takes a break: `break`  ====

Avoids directing patients to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is on a lunch break +

Format: `break <ENTRY_ID>`

==== Doctor resumes his/her duty: `resume` ====

Allows patients to be directed to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is back from his/her break. +

Format: `resume <ENTRY_ID>`

=== Staff Personal Management

==== Marks the doctor as on-duty: `onduty` ====

Marks the doctor, based on the index given, as on-duty and adds him/her to a list of on-duty doctors. +

Format: `onduty <ON_DUTY_DOCTOR_ENTRY_ID>`

==== Marks the doctor as off-duty: `offduty` ====

Marks the doctor, based on the index given, as off-duty and removes him/her from the list. +

Format: `offduty <ON_DUTY_DOCTOR_ENTRY_ID>`

=== Queue feature
The queue feature allows the user to enqueue and dequeue a patient from the queue.

* e.g. `enqueue 003A` - Enqueues the patient with `referenceId` 003A.
* e.g. `next 1` Serves the next patient in queue and allocates him/her to room 1.

Queue supports a few basic commands:

* Enqueue -- Enqueues a patient into the queue. +
Format: `enqueue <PATIENT_REFERENCE_ID>`
* Dequeue -- Dequeues a patient from the queue. +
Format: `dequeue <QUEUE_INDEX>`
* Next -- Assigns the next patient in the queue to a doctor. +
Format: `next <ENTRY_ID>`
* Break -- Avoids directing patients to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is on a lunch break +
Format: `break <ENTRY_ID>`
* Resume -- Allows patients to be directed to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is back from his/her break. +
Format: `resume <ENTRY_ID>`

==== Current Implementation
The queue will be displayed in a list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an enqueue command:

.Enqueue Activity Diagram
image::EnqueueActivityDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an next command:

.Next Activity Diagram
image::NextActivityDiagram.png[]

Below is an example usage of the queue feature.

Step 1: User enters the `enqueue E0000001A` command.

Step 2: The command then calls Model#enqueuePatient to enqueue the patient into the queue.

Step 3: Patient will then displayed in the queue.
