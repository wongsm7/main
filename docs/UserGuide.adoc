== Introduction

This program is targeted at clerks working in small clinics. It is designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). It allows clerks to manage appointments, staff's duty roster, inventories and queues. Typing fast allows you to complete your tasks much faster than GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `clerkPro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ClerkPro.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `register i/001A n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : registers a patient named `John Doe`.
* `enqueue 001A` : enqueues patient with reference id `001A` into the queue.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `register n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `register n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<NAME> p/<PHONE_NUMBER>`, `p/<PHONE_NUMBER> n/<NAME>` is also acceptable.
